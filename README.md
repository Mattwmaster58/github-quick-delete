## GitHub Quick Delete
[![Install the userscript](https://img.shields.io/badge/userscript-install-blue)](https://github.com/Mattwmaster58/github-quick-delete/raw/master/githubQuickDelete.user.js)

A simple [userscript](https://greasyfork.org/en/help/installing-user-scripts) to help you delete GitHub repos faster. The script changes the action of the delete button to instantly delete a given repo.

### Accidental Deletion

I tried to design the script to make as many checks as possible to prevent it from accidentally submitting the delete form, but I easily could have messed that up, so I encourage you to read the code (and submit any improvements via a pull request!) It's quite short.

GitHub UI designers designed the delete dialog the way they did for a reason. If you use this, you're bypassing that and making it easier to accidentally delete a repo (It's not always easy to get it back!). Please be aware of that.
